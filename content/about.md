Hey, Thanks for stopping by! I’m Deepak. I spend my day-to-day working as a Software Developer. I’ve had the opportunity to work with a wide variety of technologies and help startups build simple to complex systems over the past 10 years.

I have a huge craving towards learning something new. This means that apart from work, I spend a lot of time reading and trying out new stuff, be it a new technology, exploring different cuisines or a useless talent!
I have a lot of respect for all the open source developers who have made the world a better place. Also I have a thing to appreciate small things in life and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee" target="_blank">filter coffee</a> is my everyday motivation :)

I am currently working as a Senior Technical Consultant at <a href="https://tarkalabs.com" target="_blank">Tarkalabs</a> with few of the wonderfully cool and awesomely smart developers on the planet. Hit me up on email/twitter, I'll be able to show you a cool thing or two of mine.
